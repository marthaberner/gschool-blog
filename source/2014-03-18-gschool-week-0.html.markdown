Learning to Talk to Myself - An Introduction to Ruby
---------------------

```ruby
class Me
 def initialize(pastMe, meNow)
    if pastMe == meNow
    "Oh crap! I better stop sleeping and study
    even harder!"
    else
    "Wow, gSchool is awesome! Instant community,
    awesome learning environment!"
    end
  end
end
```
####Thankfully, ```  pastMe!= meNow ```.   In part, because I'm learning to talk to myself.

Of course, I was talking to myself before I started [gSchool](https://www.gschool.it/) Boulder 2 weeks ago, albeit much simpler ramblings, however.  My conversations
 before now were fewer and further between and consisted of light fare such as "Uh oh, did I forget to feed Howie? No, I'm pretty sure
I fed him before I left the house this morning at 6:30am...blah blah blah."

Now, I talk to myself as a rule.  I even write notes to future me.  They go something like this - "Berner, stop screwing up
your methods!  Pay attention to where you're putting things and remember *when* and *when not* to use instance variables."

My ```self.Me``` conversations now are more like "Ok, so I've got a hash and I want to change each value in that
hash and also add some new key, value pairs..." You get the idea.  Some cursing can also accommodate those conversations, and probably some
brow furrowing.  But never mind that.

My dreams are different now too.  Now they consist of giant mazes of ice blue code that whizz
by all night, making my brain feel scrambled.  As you might imagine, it's a very restful sleep.

The good news is that I am beginning to understand Ruby.  More than that even.  I am blown away at how much I know now about other things, like Terminal, Heroku and GitHub,
that didn't have a clue about two weeks ago.  I also know more people now.  Awesome people.  People who have also embarked on
a journey to grow, and learn.

At least right now, [rubymonk](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer) is helping make those conversations with myself a little more coherent.
